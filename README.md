## 🔄 Workflow Overview  

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Data Extraction (SQL)** | Extract customer and transaction data using joins, aggregations & filters. |
| **2. Data Preparation (Python)** | Handle missing values, outliers & create churn indicators. |
| **3. Analysis & Modeling (Python)** | Perform EDA, correlation analysis, churn segmentation. |
| **4. Visualization (Power BI)** | Create dashboards & KPIs for churn metrics, customer segments & revenue impact. |

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights  

### 🔹 Key Metrics  
- **Churn Rate** – % of customers lost  
- **Retention Rate** – % retained over time  
- **Revenue at Risk** – Financial impact of churn  
- **Customer Segmentation** – High-risk vs low-risk profiles  

### 🔹 Example Visuals  
- KPI Cards → Churn rate, total customers, revenue at risk  
- Trend Lines → Churn over months/quarters  
- Bar Charts → Churn by demographics or product category  
- Heatmaps → Correlations between variables and churn  
- Slicers & Filters → Explore by region, tenure, or product line

## 💡 Insights

* Early-tenure customers show higher churn probability.
* Certain demographics and product lines strongly correlate with churn.
* Targeted retention campaigns can significantly reduce churn.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Automate ETL pipelines using Python or Power BI Dataflows.
* Integrate advanced machine learning models for churn prediction.
* Deploy dashboard on Power BI Service.
