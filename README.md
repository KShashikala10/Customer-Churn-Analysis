## 📊 Dashboard Highlights – Customer Churn Analysis  

### 🔹 Key Metrics  
- **Churn Rate** – % of customers lost  
- **Retention Rate** – % retained over time  
- **Revenue at Risk** – Financial impact of churn  
- **Customer Segmentation** – High-risk vs low-risk groups  

### 🔹 Example Visuals  
- KPI Cards → Churn rate, total customers, revenue impact  
- Trend Lines → Churn over months/quarters  
- Bar Charts → Churn by demographics/product line  
- Heatmaps → Correlation between churn factors  
- Slicers & Filters → Region, tenure, product filters
